		<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<p>🌙 The Dream Behind PJ Desires:
		
Once upon a bedtime in the quiet village of Tender Lane Pembroke, there lived a woman named Khadine who had an unusual obsession with pajamas but
not just any pajamas.

She believed that the right pair could turn an ordinary night into something magical. As a little girl, Khadine would sneak into her grandmother’s room and wrap herself in soft flannel robes and silky shirts that smelled like lavender and stories. Each fabric held a memory, a dream, a lullaby.

Years later, after working long days in a cold corporate job, Khadine craved comfort. Not just for herself, but for others too. One rainy night, curled up in her favorite faded bunny pajamas, she scribbled her dream into a notebook: PJ Desires where comfort meets charm.

She started small by sewing cozy sets at her kitchen table then sharing them on social media. To her surprise, people loved them. Orders came in from sleepy students, tired parents, and even traveling authors who said Khadine’s pajamas made them feel at home no matter where they were.

What made PJ Desires special wasn’t just the soft cotton or dreamy colors it was the feeling. Each piece came with a handwritten note: “May your nights be soft, and your dreams be sweeter.”

Today, PJ Desires has grown beyond the kitchen table, but Khadine still keeps a candle lit by the window and a notebook beside her bed because sometimes, the coziest dreams are the ones you wake up and chase.</p>
